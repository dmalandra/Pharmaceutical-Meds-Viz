Pymaceuticals, Inc. is a ficticious pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications.  In this current study, we have identified 248 mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors.  We have randomly assigned mice to a variety of cancer drug regimens and monitored tumor development over the course of 45 days.  More specifically, we are comparing the drug, Capomulin, to several other treatments.  Within this repo is a detailed summary of the dataset, along with DataFrames and charts/plots/visuals.
